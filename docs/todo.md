- gifts screen:
  - add gift:
    - we seem to have lost the flow UI that was recently implemented  
- gift details screen:
  - along with the gift suggestions carousel, the link to the gift either isn't saved or goes to an image. The link (clicking anywhere on the gift card besides the buttons) should take them to the web page the gift is on (the product page)
  - there need to be a back arrow/button like other screens
  - layout/style the screen much better, considering the existing style/layout of the app and other screens
- gift suggestion card
  - change the link to be accessible via a globe (www) icon, instead of having the whole card be clickable
