# Gift Idea Minder â€“ TODOs (2025-08-22)

## Initial Setup Flow
  - [ ] Add a new screen/flow/process for this:
    - This is for initial setup of the app - triggered when it's first installed, and we can have a button to launch it again later
    - The app will introduce itself (in a clean, slick, friendly way), and will ask the user if they want to import recipients from their contact list
      - Implement functionality to import multiple contacts at once. This would include a search bar that live-searches, then the user can select 1+ recipients being displayed, then they can continue searching more. Finally, they will hit the "Next" button at the bottom, which will say "Add xx Recipients"
        - The initial display (before the user types any search in) will be to display all contacts
        - Ask for android permissions as required
      - The final step will be a quick overview of what to do next and encouragement of the user to edit their recipients (in the regular recipiens list screen) and how to add gift interests/etc
      - After that, the flow will take the user to the recipients list screen
