# Gift Idea Minder â€“ TODOs (2025-08-18)

## Features

- [ ] **Budget-respecting AI suggestions**
  - Update: `GiftSuggestionRepository` (AI prompt builder / result filter)
  - Ensure generated suggestions are constrained by the budget field in `Gift` or `Event`
  - Add fallback handling (if no suggestion within budget, return "no match")

- [ ] **Prompt for occasion when missing**
  - Update: `GiftSuggestionRepository` (AI prompt builder)
  - If no `occasion` is passed from UI, prompt user in `AddGiftScreen` (Compose)
  - Provide default (e.g., `"birthday"`) if user cancels

- [ ] **Interests & Inspirations list (General vs Specific)**
  - Update: `Person` model + Room DB (`PersonDao`, `PersonRepository`)
    - Add new table: `Interest(id, personId, type: String [General|Specific], value: String, alreadyOwned: Boolean)`
  - Update: `PersonViewModel` to load/save interests
  - Update: `PersonDetailScreen` (Compose) to show list of interests with type toggle (General/Specific)

- [ ] **Mark specifics as "already owned"**
  - Add `alreadyOwned` boolean to `Interest` entity
  - Update: `PersonDetailScreen` with checkbox for each Specific interest
  - Ensure AI prompt excludes items marked `alreadyOwned`

- [ ] **Inline auto-complete from contacts (lower priority)**
  - Update: `AddPersonScreen` (Compose)
  - Integrate Android Contacts API query while typing name
  - Show dropdown of matches; allow selecting to auto-fill person details


## NEW


### To-Dos / UX Improvements

- [ ] **Simple vs Advanced mode for Interests**
  - Add toggle in `SettingsScreen` (Compose)
  - Store in `AppSettingsRepository` (Room or DataStore)
  - Simple Mode: only allow "General" entries
  - Advanced Mode: allow General + Specific entries with "already owned" flag

- [ ] **Prompt/tip to suggest Advanced mode**
  - Update: `PersonDetailScreen`
  - If user adds 3+ specific examples while in Simple mode, show tip/snackbar suggesting Advanced mode


- [ ] fix: the general/specific tabs have been added to the new interests edit screen, but the reciepient add flow itself is using the old style of interests
- [ ] fix: the gift ideas screen coming from the person list screen:
  - hitting plus takes me to add a new gift, when it should let me add an interest
  - the UI could be much better, smoother, cleaner
- [ ] fix: the actual add gift flow screen - the "pick date" and "what's the occasion" steps are duplicate functionality - i think we can lose the "what's the occasion" screen, and the user can add occasions on the date screen. Unless you can think of a good reason we need both. I'm not sure what it's even for, because AI gift suggestion are done for a person, not for a gift idea - because a gift idea is the *result* of ai suggestions, not the source
- [ ] fix: add/edit person - gift inspirations screen, the current interests doesn't scroll. also, tighten up the UI, especially the padding between each current interest
- [ ] fix: add person screen, inline autocomplete doesn't seem to be working at all; at worst, add debug logging to the autocomplete code so I can see if it's even firing



## NEW NEW
- [ ] **Add Recipient Flow**
  - prompt for contact permissions when doing autocomplete if needed
  - scan information in the selected contact for a possible relation (e.g., sometimes people put a contact name like "Sarah (Sister)", or have the relation in a different field). use this to pre-select the relationship(s) in the next step
  - add AI suggestions from SMS history to the final step - have a checkbox on the review screen that says "scan SMS history for gift ideas" or something like that, and implement the SMS scanning in the app, taking the user to the person -> gift suggestions screen (but with the results of the sms scanned, not the standard throwing the gift inspirations at the AI)
    - also scan SMS history for inspirations - i.e., have it try to determine what the recipient likes from the conversation
  - (ensure all AI interactions anywhere are logged - at least prompt and response)
- [ ] fix: gift suggestions (on people list -> suggestions (light bulb)) still isn't pulling an image, and the web link is still going to the image url (which isn't working)
