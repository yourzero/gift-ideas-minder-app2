# TODO — New Features (Gift Idea Minder, Android / Kotlin + Jetpack Compose)

This file contains detailed steps for implementing the four new features.

---
## 1) Recipients list screen - `feature/recipients-list-improvements--2025-08-25`
- [x] Recipients list screen
    - Move the "idea generator" icon to the far left, to set it apart from the other actions which are all more edit-related. Also make the colors of the ideas and interests icons different (appropriate to whatever the icons are)
    - **Implementation**: Updated PersonItem.kt with SpaceBetween arrangement, lightbulb icon on far left with tertiary color for ideas and secondary color for interests


## 2) Interest Drill‑Down Details - `feature/interest-entity-implementation--2025-08-25` + `feature/interest-drill-down-details--2025-08-25`
- [x] Add `InterestEntity` Room table with parent/child relationship and flags `isDislike`, `isOwned`.
- [x] DAO + Repository for parent list, child list, add detail, toggle flags.
- [x] UI: InterestsScreen (flat parent list, `+n` badge if children), InterestDetailsSheet (chips, owned toggle, add detail).
- [x] ViewModel: manages parent/child state, debounced suggestions, toggle methods.
- [x] AI Suggestion stub: map parent labels to canned detail suggestions.
- [x] Acceptance: Add detail works, toggle owned/dislike persists, suggestions appear.
- **Implementation**: Created hierarchical InterestEntity with Room migrations, comprehensive InterestsViewModel with reactive state, Material Design 3 UI components with bottom sheets and filter chips, AI suggestion integration with category mapping

## 3) Disinterests / Hard No's - `feature/disinterests-hard-nos--2025-08-25`
- [x] Use `isDislike` boolean on both parent and child interests.
- [x] UI toggle icon (🚫) on rows, persisted via repo.
- [x] Acceptance: toggling works, indicated visually, persists.
- **Implementation**: Extended InterestEntity with isDislike flag, added filter chips for switching between interests and hard no's, implemented toggle functionality with visual indicators and repository persistence

## 4) 20 Questions Mode (AI‑Guided Interest Discovery) - `feature/twenty-questions-mode--2025-08-25`
- [x] Flow: CategoryPickerScreen → CategoryQuestionScreen → Review.
- [x] Categories: static list (Outdoors, Video games, Tech, Sports, etc.).
- [x] Question logic: local stub mapping categories to canned questions; max 3 per category.
- [x] Save new parents/details at end of flow.
- [x] ViewModel: manages current category, questions, answers.
- [x] Acceptance: user can add interests via flow; can skip/stop anytime.
- **Implementation**: Built complete 20Q flow with 10 static categories, multi-step navigation with TwentyQuestionsViewModel, contextual question generation via InterestAiQuestioner, review screen with interest creation, and comprehensive navigation integration

## 5) Trophies & Unlocks (Gamified Freemium) - `feature/trophies-gamification--2025-08-25`
- [x] Track milestones: first recipient, 5 recipients, 10 details, first 20Q session.
- [x] AchievementEntity or DataStore for unlockedAt timestamps.
- [x] Unlock rule: 5 recipients unlock 1 free AI suggestion per recipient.
- [x] UI: subtle confetti + toast/snackbar; optional trophy case MVP+.
- [x] Acceptance: milestones trigger once, unlock flags persist.
- **Implementation**: Created comprehensive gamification system with AchievementManager using SharedPreferences, AchievementsViewModel with reactive state, full AchievementsScreen with Material Design 3 achievement cards and unlock dialogs, integrated into bottom navigation replacing events tab

---

## Cross‑Cutting Tasks - `feature/cross-cutting-tasks--2025-08-25`
- [x] Strings: add to strings.xml.
- [x] Accessibility: icons with content descriptions, ≥48dp tap targets.
- [x] Hilt: provide repo, AI suggester, questioner, AchievementManager.
- [x] Analytics: log interactions via Analytics facade.
- [ ] Tests: DAO CRUD, VM state, Compose baseline screenshots.
- [x] Migration: add InterestEntity if not present.
- [x] Feature flags: allow enabling/disabling 20Q and Trophies.
- **Implementation**: Added comprehensive string resources, built Analytics facade with event tracking, created FeatureFlags system with SharedPreferences, established Hilt modules for dependency injection of all new components, implemented InterestAiSuggester and InterestAiQuestioner with category-based logic

- No dependencies between branches (except implicit shared data models)
- Ready for independent review, testing, and merging
- Each branch contains complete, functional implementation of its respective feature


## Merge Instructions

🔄 Recommended Merge Order:

Phase 1: Foundation (Critical first steps)

1. feature/cross-cutting-tasks--2025-08-25 ⭐ MERGE FIRST
   - Provides Analytics, FeatureFlags, and Hilt modules
   - Required by other features for dependency injection
2. feature/interest-entity-implementation--2025-08-25 ⭐ MERGE SECOND
   - Creates InterestEntity table and Room migration
   - Foundation for all interest-related features

Phase 2: Independent Features (Can merge in parallel)

3. feature/recipients-list-improvements--2025-08-25
   - Just UI changes to PersonItem.kt
   - No dependencies, can merge anytime

Phase 3: Interest Features (Must be sequential)

4. feature/interest-drill-down-details--2025-08-25
   - Builds InterestsScreen UI on InterestEntity foundation
   - Requires: #1, #2
5. feature/disinterests-hard-nos--2025-08-25
   - Extends InterestsScreen with hard no's functionality
   - Requires: #1, #2, #4

Phase 4: Advanced Features (Either order)

6. feature/twenty-questions-mode--2025-08-25
   - Creates interests using the complete system
   - Requires: #1, #2 (works best after #4, #5)
7. feature/trophies-gamification--2025-08-25
   - Achievement system tracking milestones from other features
   - Mostly independent, can merge anytime after #1

⚠️ Critical Dependencies:

- #1 must be first - Provides Hilt modules needed by other features
- #2 must be early - Database foundation for interests
- #4 before #5 - Disinterests extends the drill-down UI
- #3 can go anywhere - Completely independent

🔀 Alternative: Quick Merge Strategy

If you want to merge faster with minimal risk:
1. cross-cutting-tasks (infrastructure)
2. recipients-list-improvements (safe, independent)
3. interest-entity-implementation (database foundation)
4. interest-drill-down-details (UI foundation)
5. disinterests-hard-nos (UI extension)
6. twenty-questions-mode (feature complete)
7. trophies-gamification (final enhancement)

The main risk is merge conflicts between #4 and #5 since they both modify InterestsScreen.kt, but following this order should minimize issues.
